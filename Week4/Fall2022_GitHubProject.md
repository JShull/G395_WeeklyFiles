# GitHub Project

We are going to work through understanding how GitHub Projects can be helpful in keeping you on track.

Initially this can be confusing because GitHub projects are tied to people or organizations first. You can then assign repositories to them as needed.
You're going to think 'Repository Project Board' in reality you should be thinking 'Project Board with Repositories'.

## Kanban 

1.) Start with what you do now
2.) Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
3.) Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles
4.) Encourage acts of leadership at all levels in your organization

### Why Kanban?

* Ease of use - created everyone their board in 15 minutes.
* Flexibility - Kanban boards can be adapted
* Clarity - Kanban lets you decide how granular you want to get
* Collaboration - Where we can keep tabs on specific needs of items and work that allows all other members to drop in and get a gauge of what's going on
* Efficiency - by visualizing the work and following through with it you increase efficiency by reducing duplication of information

## Board Cards/Issues

What is a card?
Can anything be a card?

**Everyone lets create our first set of cards:**

* Unity Learn Plan
  > Work item name/job number/title: "Breakdown Unity Learn Modules"
  >
  >Priority level: High
  >
  >Issue Size: Medium (2-4 hours)
  >
  >Due date: October 5th
  >
  >Details: Go through Unity Learn and break out learn modules by interests, alignment with project idea, and time. For each module create a GitHub Issue Card with information about it.
* Unity Template Project & Version
  > Work item name/job number/title: "Pick Unity Version and Starter Template"
  >
  >Priority level: Medium
  >
  >Issue Size: Small (1-2 hours)
  >
  >Due date: October 5th
  >
  >Details: Go through some of the starter templates and/or notes from Johns one-on-one in the pulse document to see if there was a suggested starter template. Make sure that the template and version align - maybe test them before picking one and while I'm testing it think about issues/work I could do to adjust/mod this and make additional issues/cards/drafts on the project
* Class Documentation Pulse Check
  > Work item name/job number/title: "Pulse Check Document Completion"
  >
  >Priority level: High
  >
  >Issue Sie: Small (1-2 hours)
  >
  >Due date: October 5th
  >
  >Details: Confirm on the pulse check that's what I want to do - make sure it aligns with the template I've found and make sure it aligns with what I'm learning. If I saw a learning module about cameras and virtual production, could I substitute a medium task to do some additional camera training from LinkedIn Learning?
* Class Documentation Project Proposal
  >Work item name/job number/title: "Project Proposal Document Completion"
  >
  >Priority level: High
  >
  >Issue Size: Medium (2-4 hours)
  >
  >Due date: October 5th
  >
  >Details: Use the Project Proposal template in my repository and create a new document - use teh template as a guide but make sure to align the previous issues within it. Need to combine all of the other issues to do this effectively.
* Submission Pull request Odu Canvas
  >Work item name/job number/title: "Submit Project Plan"
  >
  > Priority level: Low
  >
  >Issue Size: small (less than an hour)
  >
  >Date date: October 5th
  >
  >Details: Follow the instructions on Canvas for the assignment, make sure all of my documents are done, confirm that I am working on Developer branch, request a pull request in that I want to take Developer and merge it into Main. Assign John as the reviewer and when ready ask for the pull request. When the pull request is activated - grab the link and drop it in the Canvas Submission

## GitHub Desktop and VSCode Integration with Commits

GitHub allows commits to be crafted in a way to have them be directly tied to existing issues. For example - let me setup and clone my repository as I am supposed to - make sure I'm on Developer branch and let me start working on some of my documents.

At any point I decide to save a file and make sure it's backed up with GitHub - I can use some special characters within my commit to activate a service that lets me assign this commit to an issue... it's really cool and a nice way to work.

You can also reference this information directly in VSCode markdown!! This is really fun... let's look at how I can mention this in my proposal!
