# Raycasts

Raycast in Unity is a physics operation in which we use vectors to give us information about our world. Raycasts or some form of a 'vector' are probably used in every single major game engine as it literally points right back to mathematical operations.

## Vectors Euclidean Geometry

A raycast is simple: it's just a Vector. I'm referencing euclidean vectors, but you should be aware that a 'vector' can mean different things in different contexts, but for our purposes euclidean vector = 'vector'

A vector has length (magnitude) and direction and what you will see a lot within Physics based simulation engines like Unity is the use of vectors within rigidbodies and/or other physics needs.

## Physics

Velocity and acceleration of a moving object and those forces can be explained by utilizing vectors. We can use cross product to help with alignment and we can use dot product to help with things like 'is an enemy facing me?!'
