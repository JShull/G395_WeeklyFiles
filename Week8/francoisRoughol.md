## How this is going to Work

Going to go around the room after I ask a couple initial questions. Have your question ready - if you don't have a question when we get to you and/or the answer was already out there just pass it on to the next individual.

## Questions

Francois, can I open it up and get you to talk about what got you first into video games?

I know you're an avid photographer - how did games help you become a better photographer and vice versa?

This class and current students are struggling with version control and checking in and out of files - can you talk about how your group manages work across multiple people and maybe give us some insight into why this is important?

One of my favorite games of all time is BioShock Infinite, what is your favorite contribution to that game?

Can you describe an example tasking issue that you might assign to someone who is in your team?

If you could take what you know now, and go back to any single game you published, what game, and what would you do different?

What stands out for you on a resume/application?

Francois - What would you tell your younger-self who just landed his first gig working on Rayman at Ubisoft?

### Random Questions

I know we had talked a few years back and at the time you couldn't tell me the game you were on - I now know that was Beyond good and evil 2 - can you talk about what happened and/or why you switched it up?

Given *'but does it run Crysis'*, do you ever look back and just go 'holy shit' I was part of that?
